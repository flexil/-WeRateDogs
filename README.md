Udacity Nano Degree Scholarship
The project 2 WeRateDogs a twitter account which has 9.3 million followers across the world at the point this blog is published contains three datasets namely twitter-archive-enhanced.csv, image_predictions.tsv and tweet_json.txt which we have to programmatically download from three different sources. Two from website URLs and the last one requires the learner to sign up for twitter developer account to collect additional tweet through twitter API. The objective of this project is to challenge the learner to wrangle the three datasets and to combine all the three clean datasets into a twitter master archive by providing at least four insights and two visualizations.
